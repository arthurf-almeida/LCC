                    <h3>Les Intouchables</h3> 
                    <p align="justify">The movie starts with Driss, our main character, in a fancy car with Philippe, Driss is driving
                        recklessly to a place unknown to the audience, they are then stopped by the police, who gets 
                        tricked by them into thinking Phihlippe needs to go to the hospital, in this scene we learn that
                        Philippe is paraplegic, when arriving at the hospital, the police go find a wheelchair for Philippe,
                        so they take this chance to leave. The movie then goes back to when Driss and Philippe first met,
                        Driss applied for a job of taking care of Philippe, in which he was hired. In his first day of work,
                        he messes around, doesn't do his job properly, and is later challenged by Philippe to last a month in his job.
                    </p> 
                    <p align="justify">After some time, they start to get along and quickly become friends, Driss also makes friends
                         with the other workers, except for Elisa, Philippe's daughter, he also flirts with Magalie, who doesn't give
                         him much attention. Driss discovers that Philippe has a 'lover' who exchanges letters with him, Driss does
                         not understand why they don't go further into their relationship and helps Philippe make some moves. Things
                         start to get better between Phihlippe and his lover, but goes down as their expected date doesn't happen.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">Driss quits his job because of family issues and Philippe has to hire someone else, but as time
                         passes, Philippe gets more sad as he misses his friend, until one night, Driss comes back and they both go for
                         a ride, which is where the first scene happens. They get to the airport and fly to another place, where Driss
                         prepares his friend for a date with his lover, which he doesn't know about. There's a funny scene where Driss is 
                         shaving Philippe's beard in many different styles, including a square, when they get to the restaurant Driss
                         starts talking and leaves, that's when Philippe's lover comes, the scene then moves to Driss as he is walking
                         and the movie ends.
                    </p>
