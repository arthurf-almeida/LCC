                            the process of Moodlight Project and the problems I had. </br>

                      <h3>Sketches, Bench Skills and Machine Skills</h3>         

                      <p style="line-height: 25px">The first part was fairly easy and enjoyable, because sketching is something 
                          I like to do and didn't have any problems with it. I cut the main piece with a hacksaw and used 
                          a file to file off the edges, again, this part was very easy, but the next part was a bit harder,
                          I had to use the drill to make 2 holes on the piece, to use the machine was easy, the hard part was
                          to find the screw to drill the hole. </p>    

                      <p style="line-height: 25px">It was hard because some of the screws are in a specific place separated by size, 
                          but not all the screws are there, some of them are beside it and not separated by size, the one I was
                       looking for didn't say what size it was, which is 0.5cm, so I got a 0.7cm screw and looked for one that 
                      was a bit smaller but not that small, luckily it was the right one. </p>    

                      <p style="line-height: 25px">Right after that, I used the strip heater to bend the piece, I struggled a lot with
                           this part because I kept heating the wrong place, so I had to heat it again, bend it into
                           the original shape and do it over and over again, until I did it right. </p> </br> 
                 </div> 
                 <div class="part3">      
                     <h3>Finishing</h3>    
                     <p  style="line-height: 25px"> Now that the piece has been bend I glued it with the side pieces and started 
                         doing the circuit,  even though it was my second time doing a circuit it wasnâ€™t all that hard, 
                         the only part that I struggled with was  striping the wires, because I was pulling the wire striper
                          too strong, so it was cutting the whole wire, but after 3 or 4 times trying I managed to do it.</p>   

                      <p style="line-height: 25px">With the circuit done I glued it in the inside of the moodlight with hot glue 
                          so it doesn't fall and used the Lathe machine to make a hole and smooth the top of a bubble bar
                          to put it on the LED. It was my first time using the Lathe machine so I was nervous to use it, but 
                          thankfully it went all right, then I glued the bubble bar on the top of the LED.</p> </br>

                     <h3>Self Analysis and Evaluation</h3> 
                     <p style="line-height: 25px">According to the proposed activity I worked well and I achieved its objective,
                         even though I had some difficulties during the execution I managed to make a good job.
